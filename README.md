## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		

Lesson 4 writing prompts.


Callback Functions 
Closure 
arguments 
Recursion 
prototype 
Constructors 
<b>Callback Functions</b> (a closure) allow you to pass a function into another function as an argument, allowing the callback function to be ran within this other function. 

<b>Closure</b> allows for the local variables of a function to be used even after that function has been returned.

<b>arguments</b> are values passed to a function.  They are the variables you see within the parenthesis of a function and allow you to call on data passed to the function by referencing said argument.

<b>Recursion</b> simply put is when a function calls itself. Instead of using a loop, you can just call on the original function again.

<b>prototype</b> essentially the contents of an object. A name for all of the properties within an object.

<b>Constructors</b> a method for creating an multiple objects with the same properties and methods.  Constructors provide a similar function as classes in other languages.
